## Installation

You can install the `lightning-proxies` package directly from PyPI using `pip`:

```bash
pip install lightning-proxies
```

## Example usage
```python
from lightning_proxies import LightningProxiesAPI

# Initialize the client with your API key
client = LightningProxiesAPI(api_key="your_api_key")

# Get residential proxy information using plan ID
plan_id = "648248c31fac1bd9475b61ba"
response = client.get_residential_proxy_info(plan_id)

print(response)
```
## Example: Add an IP to the Whitelist
```python
from lightning_proxies import LightningProxiesAPI

# Initialize the client with your API key
client = LightningProxiesAPI(api_key="your_api_key")

# Add an IP address to the whitelist for IPv6 proxies
plan_id = "648248c31fac1bd9475b61ba"
ip_address = "1.1.1.1"
response = client.add_ip_to_whitelist(plan_id, ip_address)

print(response)
